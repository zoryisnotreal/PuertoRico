         <h1> Family History </h1>
         <p> My family comes from Cabo Rojo. Currently, we own a small house in the forest there. 
            My grandmother moved to the United States with her mother when she was still in her teens. While her birth name was “Sol Ida”, her American name became a misinterpreted version of her name, “Zorida”. 
            She moved to the Bronx and met a man named “Zapata”, where they had my mom and my aunt. 
            While the marriage went sour, it led to a happy divorce and a better marriage obtained through my grandfather, where they had my uncle.
