         <h1> Puerto Rican Food History </h1>
         <h2> Puerto Rican cuisine has a rich history, known for its intersection in native, afro-Caribbean, and Spanish cuisine. 
         </h2>
         <p>
            <span class="quote">“The history and development of Puerto Rican cuisine begin with the Taíno Indians, the natives Columbus found at discovery. Some Taíno foods still used today include yuca, peppers, and corn. Taínos invented the barbacoa and used a pilón to mash their ingredients and paints.
            The Spaniards brought a variety of new ingredients including, olives, garlic, bacalao, and cilantro. The various culinary specialties of the Iberian peninsula also had an important role in the development of Puerto Rican food (6).”</span>
            Some modern ways Puerto Ricans hold onto traditional lessons is using a caldero––an aluminum cauldron used to cook rice.
