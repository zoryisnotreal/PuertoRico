                  <h2>Tainos</h2>
                  <p>The Tainos were the indigenous population of Puerto Rico. The group called themselves boricua and the island went by the name “Borinquen”. 
                     Tainos inhabited many Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispanola (the current island shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti). 
                     Coastal parts of Latin America were also inhabited by Tainos, who shared a different culture and lifestyle compared to their island counterparts.

                  <h2>The Invasion of the Spaniards</h2>
                  <p>After the expedition of Christopher Columbus in 1493, discovering the island and its natives, Borinquen transformed into the island of Puerto Rico under colonial rule. By the 16th Century, Puerto Rico became a max exporter in sugar cane, tobacco, coffee, and more. 
                     The Spanish imported more slaves into Puerto Rico, which became one of the main sources of its Afro-Caribbean culture.

                  <h2>United States Tyranny</h2>
                  <p>After the Spanish American War, the Foraker Act of 1898 placed Puerto Rico under United States’ ownership.
                     Under Spanish rule, Puerto Rico held some autonomy. But under US rule, the excise control and lack of civil liberties and rights angered the people. 
                     In 1917, the United States granted all Puerto Ricans US Citizenship for the sole purpose of drafting all potential men into WWI.

                  <h2>Today</h2>
                  <p>Puerto Rico faces major economic crises. 
                     Lack of governmental support, lack of representation in government, the influx of natural disasters––all of these factors have pitted Puerto Rico into a steep crisis. 
                     But today people are seeking to make a change, there are many debates between Puerto Rico becoming a state or a free nation. But the overall goal is to help Puerto Rico evolve from the state it was reduced to.
