         <h2> The Tainos are the natives of Puerto Rico. </h2>
         <p> The Tainos are the natives of Puerto Rico. 
            The Tainos held a unique position of women in society. Opposing the cultures of Spain and the US, Tainos viewed women as equals to men. Women had the right to become priests and men moved into a womanâ€™s home after marriage, belonging to her family instead. 
            Leisure was also a common practice, as rest was a major part of the culture and can be seen in the symbols left by the Tainos. 
            Tainos reflected the nature around them. The Boricuas were a predominantly fishing tribe, which can be seen in Puerto Rico today as fishing is a popular source of income.
