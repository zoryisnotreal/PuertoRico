         <h1> My Experience </h1>
         <p> As a Puerto Rican in the United States, I have a lot of passion for the history of my island. 
            While the assumption may be that I am as American as someone whose family history starts in Jersey, I know that Puerto Rican history is fulfilled with a complex culture that is not meant for any country to control. 
            Visiting Puerto Rico is an escape from the United States (and every issue that comes with it), it is a reminder of the family I have back home, the culture that I will always be a part of, and the uniqueness of my experience––whether I am a Puerto Rican from the island or the Bronx.
         <p>
